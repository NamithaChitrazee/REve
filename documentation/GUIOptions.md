# Mu2e Event Display GUI

## Toggle Menu

The toggle menu includes everything that is displayed in the browser. Our custom products are divided into two `Scenes`:

* GeomScene
* EventScene

## Zooming and Keyboard shortcuts

The mouse can be used to zoom in and out and scroll in full 3D. The `shift` key can be used to recenter.

## Text Entry

Text entry is limited. We are working to advance the options.

## MouseOvers

All products have useful "mouseover" labels. Place your mouse on a track/hit/cluster and you will see information relating to the features of that product.
