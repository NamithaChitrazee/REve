## Examples
The current available options for the .fcl are located in the ```examples``` directory. There are four main examples:

* nominal_MDC2020.fcl: with the original CRV geometry, to be used the MDC2020 samples
* nominal_MDC2025.fcl: with the MDC2025 CRV geometry assuming the common GDML
* extracted_MDC2020.fcl: for those still using MDC2020 extracted samples, to be retired
* extracted_MDC2025.fcl: for those doing extracted studies with MDC2025 samples
* nominal_Run1A.fcl: Run1A CRV geometry MDC2025
* nominal_Run2.fcl: full CRV geometry, MDC2025

These .fcl can be edited as you wish (adding or removing certain features), they should provide good starting points for any study.
